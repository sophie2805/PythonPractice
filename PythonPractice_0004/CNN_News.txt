Uggie, the scene-stealing Jack Russell terrier who charmed audiences in the Oscar-winning 2011 film "The Artist," has died.
His Los Angeles-based owner and trainer, Omar Von Mueller, announced Uggie's death early Wednesday in a post on his Facebook page. The 13-year-old dog had a cancerous tumor in the prostate, he said.
"We regret to inform to all our friends, family and Uggie's fans that our beloved boy has passed away," Von Mueller wrote. "In short, Uggie ... is now in a better place not feeling pain. Thank you for your support, I will not be reading any comments for a while as it is too painful at the moment."
In "The Artist," about the rise and fall of two Hollywood actors of the 1920s, Uggie played "Jack," the loyal pet of silent-film star George Valentin, whose career took a nosedive with the advent of talking pictures. In one of the movie's more dramatic scenes, Jack helped rescue the depressed George from a fire and saved his life.
